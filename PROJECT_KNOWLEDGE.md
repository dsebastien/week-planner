# Week Planner Project

## Project Overview
A visual week planning application built with TypeScript, HTML5 Canvas, and modern web technologies. The application allows users to create, edit, and manage time blocks across a weekly grid interface.

## Main concepts
- Week: Monday to Sunday
- Hours: 05:00 to 24:00
- Time slot: Hours split in 30 minute time slots
- Time block: time to spend on some activity

## Business rules
- Time blocks can span from 30 minutes to the whole week
- Time blocks MUST NOT overlap each other
- Time blocks MUST remain within the grid

## User interface
The UI is a grid on a Canvas with:
- Grid precisely sized to content (no extra space below 00:00)
- Rows: Time slots (30-minute intervals from 05:00 to 23:30)
- Responsive time slot height (minimum 20px, scales with screen size)
- Columns: Days (Monday through Sunday)
- Equal width columns across full viewport width
- Time labels: HH:mm format positioned clearly at grid intersections
- Lunch time highlight: Lighter background for 12:00-14:00 period
- Time blocks display start time, end time, duration in top-left corner
- Block text centered and bold within each time block

Behavior:
- Clicking on an empty cell in the grid creates a time block
- Clicking and dragging in the grid creates a time block that can span over multiple time slots/days
- Double clicking on an empty cell creates a single 30-minute time block in that cell
- Time blocks snap to 30-minute grid intersections
- Interaction restricted to valid time range (05:00-23:30 only)
- Clicking on the "..." in the top right shows the menu
- Double clicking on a time block edits the text in the block
- Delete/Backspace keys remove selected time blocks
- Escape key cancels text editing
- **Resize functionality**: Selected blocks show resize handles (blue squares) at corners and edges
- Dragging resize handles resizes blocks while preventing overlaps with other blocks
- Resize operations snap to grid boundaries and maintain minimum size constraints

Menu actions:
- Export to PNG, SVG, JSON
- Import from JSON

## Domain model
Time blocks:
- id
- X position
- Y position
- Start time
- Duration
- Day span (number of days: 1-7)
- Text
- Color (string)
- Selected (boolean)


## Architecture

### Core Components
- **WeekPlanner** (`src/week-planner.ts`) - Main application controller handling UI events and coordination
- **TimeBlockManager** (`src/time-block-manager.ts`) - Manages time blocks with validation and overlap detection  
- **CanvasRenderer** (`src/canvas-renderer.ts`) - Handles all Canvas drawing operations and export functionality
- **GridUtils** (`src/grid-utils.ts`) - Utility functions for grid calculations, time formatting, and coordinate conversions

### Technology Stack
- **TypeScript** with strict configuration (no any types, comprehensive type safety)
- **HTML5 Canvas** for rendering the grid and time blocks
- **ES2020 modules** for clean module architecture
- **Node.js built-in test runner** for unit testing

## Key Features

### Grid System
- Time slots: 30-minute intervals from 06:00 to 24:00
- Days: Monday through Sunday
- Full viewport utilization with responsive design
- Precise grid snapping for time block placement

### Time Block Management
- Create blocks by clicking and dragging
- Newly created blocks are not auto-selected (cleaner UI state)
- **Multi-Selection Support**: Select multiple blocks using Ctrl+click
- **Batch Operations**: Apply styling changes to all selected blocks simultaneously
- **Smart Toolbar Positioning**: Styling panel automatically repositions to center of selection for multi-block operations
- Automatic overlap prevention
- Duration validation (minimum 30 minutes, multiples of 30)
- Text editing via double-click
- Manual selection required for block operations
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - Delete/Backspace removes all selected blocks
  - Escape cancels editing or deselects all blocks
  - Ctrl+A selects all blocks
  - Ctrl+click toggles individual block selection
  - **Ctrl+Z performs undo operation**
  - **Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z performs redo operation**

### Export/Import System
- **PNG Export**: Canvas-based image export
- **SVG Export**: Vector-based export with proper styling
- **JSON Export/Import**: Clean domain-only data format without rendering concerns
  - Exports logical coordinates (startDay, startTime, duration, daySpan)
  - Includes styling and business properties (text, color, fontSize, etc.)
  - Excludes calculated pixel positions (x, y, width, height)
  - Excludes UI state properties (selected)
  - Imported blocks default to unselected state
  - Portable and zoom-independent format

### UI/UX
- Dark theme with Inter font family
- Menu system (⋯ button) with organized options
- Visual feedback with preview blocks during creation
- Selection highlighting with dashed borders
- Responsive canvas resizing


## Development Setup

### Scripts
```json
{
  "build": "tsc",
  "build:test": "tsc -p tsconfig.test.json", 
  "serve": "http-server -p 8080 .",
  "dev": "npm run build && npm run serve",
  "test": "npm run build:test && node --test tests-dist/tests/**/*.test.js"
}
```

## TypeScript Configuration

### Strict Settings
- `noImplicitAny: true`
- `noImplicitReturns: true`
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`
- Complete type safety without any `any` types

### ES Module Configuration
- **Target**: ES2020 with ES2020 modules for modern browser support
- **Import Extensions**: TypeScript source files use `.js` extensions for relative imports
- **Reason**: ES modules served directly in browser (no bundler) require explicit `.js` extensions
- **Example**: `import { GridUtils } from './grid-utils.js';` (correct for this setup)
- **Build Output**: TypeScript preserves import paths as-is in compiled JavaScript

### Domain Types
```typescript
interface TimeBlock {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly startTime: number; // minutes from 00:00
  readonly duration: number;  // minutes (multiple of 30)
  readonly startDay: number;  // starting day index (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday)
  readonly daySpan: number;   // 1-7 days
  text: string;
  readonly color: string;     // hex format
  readonly textColor: HexColor;
  readonly fontSize: number;
  readonly fontStyle: FontStyle;
  readonly textAlignment: TextAlignment;
  readonly verticalAlignment: VerticalAlignment;
  readonly borderStyle: BorderStyle;
  readonly cornerRadius: number;
  selected: boolean;
}

interface TimeBlockManager {
  // Multi-selection state
  private selectedBlockIds: Set<string>;
  
  // Multi-selection methods
  toggleBlockSelection(blockId: string): void;
  selectBlocks(blockIds: string[]): void;
  getSelectedBlocks(): readonly RenderedTimeBlock[];
  getSelectedBlockCount(): number;
  updateSelectedBlocksStyle(updates: Partial<TimeBlock>): Result<void, ValidationError>;
  removeSelectedBlocks(): number;
}

interface RenderedTimeBlock extends TimeBlock {
  readonly x: number;      // calculated pixel position
  readonly y: number;      // calculated pixel position
  readonly width: number;  // calculated pixel width
  readonly height: number; // calculated pixel height
}

interface GridConfig {
  startHour: number;          // 6 for 06:00
  endHour: number;            // 24 for 00:00 (next day)
  timeSlotHeight: number;     // height in pixels for 30 minutes
  dayWidth: number;           // width in pixels for one day
  headerHeight: number;       // height for day labels
  timeColumnWidth: number;    // width for time labels
  days: readonly string[];
  canvasWidth: number;        // actual canvas width
  canvasHeight: number;       // actual canvas height
}

type Result<T, E = Error> = 
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: E };
```

## Testing

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient Canvas rendering with high-quality settings
- Event debouncing for window resize
- Immutable state management
- Proper memory cleanup

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting ES2020
- HTML5 Canvas API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- ES Modules

## Deployment
- Static file serving via http-server
- No backend dependencies
- Client-side only application
- Runs on port 8080 by default

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Logical Coordinate Architecture
```typescript
// Domain model stores logical coordinates only
interface TimeBlock {
  startDay: number;     // 0-6 (Monday-Sunday)
  startTime: number;    // minutes from 00:00
  duration: number;     // minutes (multiple of 30)
  daySpan: number;      // 1-7 days
  // ... styling properties
}

// Rendering extends domain model with pixel coordinates
interface RenderedTimeBlock extends TimeBlock {
  x: number;           // calculated from startDay + config
  y: number;           // calculated from startTime + config  
  width: number;       // calculated from daySpan + config
  height: number;      // calculated from duration + config
}

// Dynamic position calculation (zoom-resistant)
const calculatePixelProperties = (startDay, startTime, duration, daySpan, config) => {
  return {
    x: config.timeColumnWidth + startDay * config.dayWidth,
    y: config.headerHeight + ((startTime - config.startHour * 60) / 30) * config.timeSlotHeight,
    width: daySpan * config.dayWidth,
    height: (duration / 30) * config.timeSlotHeight
  };
};
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Result pattern for operations that can fail
const result = timeBlockManager.addBlock(block);
if (result.success) {
  // Handle success
} else {
  console.error(result.error.message);
}
```

### Event Management
```typescript
// Proper event listener setup with binding
this.canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', this.onMouseDown.bind(this));
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Immutable updates
const updatedBlock: TimeBlock = { ...existingBlock, text: newText };
this.blocks.set(blockId, updatedBlock);
```

## Security Considerations
- Input validation on all user data
- Hex color format validation
- File size limits for import functionality
- XSS prevention in text content

## Key Lessons Learned
1. **Type Safety First**: Strict TypeScript configuration prevents runtime errors
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each class has a single responsibility
3. **Validation is Critical**: Business rules must be enforced at the data layer
4. **Testing Pays Off**: Comprehensive tests catch edge cases early
5. **User Experience**: Visual feedback and keyboard shortcuts improve usability
6. **Clean Architecture**: Modular design makes code maintainable and testable
7. **Canvas Rendering Order**: Drawing order matters - lines can hide text if drawn later
8. **ES Module Imports**: TypeScript imports must use `.js` extensions for ES modules served directly in browser without bundler

  - **Priority System**: Bottom edge blocks always get panel placed above to prevent going outside grid
  - **No Calculations**: Eliminated complex space calculations and collision detection algorithms
  - **Positioning Logic**:
    - Bottom left corner → Panel top-right of block
    - Bottom right corner → Panel top-left of block  
    - Bottom edge → Panel above block
    - Right edge → Panel left of block
    - Left edge → Panel right of block

## Previous Fixes & Improvements

### Grid Boundary & Time Slot Issues (Fixed)
- **Fixed**: Time labels overlapping with grid lines
  - **Problem**: 06:00 label hidden behind grid line, poor visibility
  - **Solution**: Position 06:00 label 8px below grid line, others at grid intersections
  - **Result**: Perfect visibility of all time labels

- **Fixed**: Invalid time slot interactions beyond 23:30
  - **Problem**: Users could click/drag below 23:30, causing "end time cannot be after 24:00" errors
  - **Solutions Applied**:
    - Updated `getGridBounds()` to limit `maxY` to valid time slots only
    - Enhanced `snapToGrid()` to clamp coordinates within valid bounds
    - Added duration validation in block creation to prevent exceeding 24:00
    - Modified `updateBlockCreation()` to respect time boundaries
  - **Result**: Completely prevents interaction beyond 23:30, no more validation errors

- **Fixed**: Unwanted cells below 00:00 time line
  - **Problem**: Grid extended beyond 00:00 with empty, unnecessary space
  - **Solution**: Precise canvas height calculation based on actual time slots needed
  - **Formula**: `headerHeight + (totalSlots × optimalSlotHeight)` - no extra space
  - **Result**: Grid ends exactly at 00:00 line with no cells below

- **Fixed**: Bulletproof cell detection for both double-click and drag block creation
  - **Problem**: Double-clicking and drag creation sometimes created blocks in wrong time slots due to grid snapping
  - **Root Cause**: `snapToGrid()` uses `Math.round()` which can snap to adjacent cells when clicking near edges
  - **Solution**: Implemented `getCellFromPoint()` method using `Math.floor()` for precise cell detection
  - **Method**: Directly calculates which cell a point falls into without rounding/snapping
  - **Applied To**: Both `createBlockInCell()` (double-click) and `updateBlockCreation()` (drag)
  - **Result**: Time blocks now always start exactly in the cell that was clicked/dragged from

- **Fixed**: Text visibility in 30-minute time blocks
  - **Problem**: Text was invisible in small (30-minute) time blocks due to layout constraints
  - **Root Cause**: Text layout reserved 36px (20px time info + 16px padding) but minimum block height was only 20px
  - **Solution**: Implemented adaptive rendering for small blocks (< 40px height)
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Compact time display: Show only start time (e.g., "09:30") instead of full range
    - Smaller time font (9px) positioned in top-left corner with minimal padding
    - Reduce text padding from 8px to 3px for small blocks
    - Reserve only 12px for compact time info (vs 20px for full format)
    - Use smaller text font (11px vs 13px) for better fit
    - Center text vertically in small blocks instead of using wrapped text
    - Apply same adaptive logic to preview blocks during drag operations
  - **Result**: Both time information and text are clearly visible in all block sizes

- **Fixed**: Drag behavior when mouse goes outside grid boundaries and browser window
  - **Problem**: Preview block disappeared when dragging outside grid, operation cancelled on mouse release; also failed when mouse left browser window/tab
  - **Root Cause**: `getCellFromPoint()` returned `null` for points outside grid, causing early return in `updateBlockCreation()`, and canvas events stopped firing outside window
  - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive drag tracking system
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Added `clampPointToGrid()` method to constrain coordinates to grid boundaries
    - Modified `updateBlockCreation()` to clamp current point before cell detection
    - Added document-level `mousemove` and `mouseup` events for tracking outside browser window
    - Enhanced `onMouseLeave()` to preserve drag state when leaving canvas
    - Added `getMousePositionFromDocument()` for handling document-level coordinate calculations
    - Preview block stays visible and functional even when mouse leaves window
    - Block creation completes normally regardless of where mouse is released
  - **Result**: Robust drag experience that works seamlessly across canvas, outside grid, and outside browser window
