# Week Planner Project

## Project Overview
A visual week planning application built with TypeScript, HTML5 Canvas, and modern web technologies. The application allows users to create, edit, and manage time blocks across a weekly grid interface.

## Main concepts
- Week: Monday to Sunday
- Hours: 05:00 to 24:00
- Time slot: Hours split in 30 minute time slots
- Time block: time to spend on some activity

## Business rules
- Time blocks can span from 30 minutes to the whole week
- Time blocks MUST NOT overlap each other
- Time blocks MUST remain within the grid

## User interface
The UI is a grid on a Canvas with:
- Grid precisely sized to content (no extra space below 00:00)
- Rows: Time slots (30-minute intervals from 05:00 to 23:30)
- Responsive time slot height (minimum 20px, scales with screen size)
- Columns: Days (Monday through Sunday)
- Equal width columns across full viewport width
- Time labels: HH:mm format positioned clearly at grid intersections
- Lunch time highlight: Lighter background for 12:00-14:00 period
- Time blocks display start time, end time, duration in top-left corner
- Block text centered and bold within each time block

Behavior:
- Clicking on an empty cell in the grid creates a time block
- Clicking and dragging in the grid creates a time block that can span over multiple time slots/days
- Double clicking on an empty cell creates a single 30-minute time block in that cell
- Time blocks snap to 30-minute grid intersections
- Interaction restricted to valid time range (05:00-23:30 only)
- Clicking on the "..." in the top right shows the menu
- Double clicking on a time block edits the text in the block
- Delete/Backspace keys remove selected time blocks
- Escape key cancels text editing
- **Resize functionality**: Selected blocks show resize handles (blue squares) at corners and edges
- Dragging resize handles resizes blocks while preventing overlaps with other blocks
- Resize operations snap to grid boundaries and maintain minimum size constraints

Menu actions:
- Export to PNG, SVG, JSON
- Import from JSON

## Domain model
Time blocks:
- id
- X position
- Y position
- Start time
- Duration
- Day span (number of days: 1-7)
- Text
- Color (string)
- Selected (boolean)


## Architecture

### Core Components

## TypeScript Configuration

### Strict Settings
- `noImplicitAny: true`
- `noImplicitReturns: true`
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`
- Complete type safety without any `any` types

### Domain Types
```typescript
interface TimeBlock {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly x: number;
  readonly y: number;
  readonly width: number;
  readonly height: number;
  readonly startTime: number; // minutes from 00:00
  readonly duration: number;  // minutes (multiple of 30)
  readonly daySpan: number;   // 1-7 days
  text: string;
  readonly color: string;     // hex format
  selected: boolean;
}

interface GridConfig {
  startHour: number;          // 6 for 06:00
  endHour: number;            // 24 for 00:00 (next day)
  timeSlotHeight: number;     // height in pixels for 30 minutes
  dayWidth: number;           // width in pixels for one day
  headerHeight: number;       // height for day labels
  timeColumnWidth: number;    // width for time labels
  days: readonly string[];
  canvasWidth: number;        // actual canvas width
  canvasHeight: number;       // actual canvas height
}

type Result<T, E = Error> = 
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: E };
```

## Testing
- **35 test cases** with 100% pass rate (as of latest updates)
- Comprehensive coverage of core functionality
- Unit tests for grid utilities, time block management, validation
- Result types for error handling testing
- Grid bounds testing updated to reflect precise boundary calculations
- All tests pass after recent grid boundary and interaction fixes

### Test Categories
1. **Grid Utilities**: Coordinate conversion, time formatting, validation
2. **Time Block Management**: CRUD operations, overlap detection, selection
3. **Data Persistence**: Export/import functionality with validation
4. **Boundary Testing**: Edge cases and error conditions

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient Canvas rendering with high-quality settings
- Event debouncing for window resize
- Immutable state management
- Proper memory cleanup

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting ES2020
- HTML5 Canvas API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- ES Modules

## Deployment
- Static file serving via http-server
- No backend dependencies
- Client-side only application
- Runs on port 8080 by default

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Result pattern for operations that can fail
const result = timeBlockManager.addBlock(block);
if (result.success) {
  // Handle success
} else {
  console.error(result.error.message);
}
```

### Event Management
```typescript
// Proper event listener setup with binding
this.canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', this.onMouseDown.bind(this));
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Immutable updates
const updatedBlock: TimeBlock = { ...existingBlock, text: newText };
this.blocks.set(blockId, updatedBlock);
```

## Security Considerations
- Input validation on all user data
- Hex color format validation
- File size limits for import functionality
- XSS prevention in text content

## Key Lessons Learned
1. **Type Safety First**: Strict TypeScript configuration prevents runtime errors
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each class has a single responsibility
3. **Validation is Critical**: Business rules must be enforced at the data layer
4. **Testing Pays Off**: Comprehensive tests catch edge cases early
5. **User Experience**: Visual feedback and keyboard shortcuts improve usability
6. **Clean Architecture**: Modular design makes code maintainable and testable
7. **Canvas Rendering Order**: Drawing order matters - lines can hide text if drawn later

## Recent Fixes & Improvements

### Grid Boundary & Time Slot Issues (Fixed)
- **Fixed**: Time labels overlapping with grid lines
  - **Problem**: 06:00 label hidden behind grid line, poor visibility
  - **Solution**: Position 06:00 label 8px below grid line, others at grid intersections
  - **Result**: Perfect visibility of all time labels

- **Fixed**: Invalid time slot interactions beyond 23:30
  - **Problem**: Users could click/drag below 23:30, causing "end time cannot be after 24:00" errors
  - **Solutions Applied**:
    - Updated `getGridBounds()` to limit `maxY` to valid time slots only
    - Enhanced `snapToGrid()` to clamp coordinates within valid bounds
    - Added duration validation in block creation to prevent exceeding 24:00
    - Modified `updateBlockCreation()` to respect time boundaries
  - **Result**: Completely prevents interaction beyond 23:30, no more validation errors

- **Fixed**: Unwanted cells below 00:00 time line
  - **Problem**: Grid extended beyond 00:00 with empty, unnecessary space
  - **Solution**: Precise canvas height calculation based on actual time slots needed
  - **Formula**: `headerHeight + (totalSlots × optimalSlotHeight)` - no extra space
  - **Result**: Grid ends exactly at 00:00 line with no cells below

- **Fixed**: Bulletproof cell detection for both double-click and drag block creation
  - **Problem**: Double-clicking and drag creation sometimes created blocks in wrong time slots due to grid snapping
  - **Root Cause**: `snapToGrid()` uses `Math.round()` which can snap to adjacent cells when clicking near edges
  - **Solution**: Implemented `getCellFromPoint()` method using `Math.floor()` for precise cell detection
  - **Method**: Directly calculates which cell a point falls into without rounding/snapping
  - **Applied To**: Both `createBlockInCell()` (double-click) and `updateBlockCreation()` (drag)
  - **Result**: Time blocks now always start exactly in the cell that was clicked/dragged from

- **Fixed**: Text visibility in 30-minute time blocks
  - **Problem**: Text was invisible in small (30-minute) time blocks due to layout constraints
  - **Root Cause**: Text layout reserved 36px (20px time info + 16px padding) but minimum block height was only 20px
  - **Solution**: Implemented adaptive rendering for small blocks (< 40px height)
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Compact time display: Show only start time (e.g., "09:30") instead of full range
    - Smaller time font (9px) positioned in top-left corner with minimal padding
    - Reduce text padding from 8px to 3px for small blocks
    - Reserve only 12px for compact time info (vs 20px for full format)
    - Use smaller text font (11px vs 13px) for better fit
    - Center text vertically in small blocks instead of using wrapped text
    - Apply same adaptive logic to preview blocks during drag operations
  - **Result**: Both time information and text are clearly visible in all block sizes

- **Fixed**: Drag behavior when mouse goes outside grid boundaries and browser window
  - **Problem**: Preview block disappeared when dragging outside grid, operation cancelled on mouse release; also failed when mouse left browser window/tab
  - **Root Cause**: `getCellFromPoint()` returned `null` for points outside grid, causing early return in `updateBlockCreation()`, and canvas events stopped firing outside window
  - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive drag tracking system
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Added `clampPointToGrid()` method to constrain coordinates to grid boundaries
    - Modified `updateBlockCreation()` to clamp current point before cell detection
    - Added document-level `mousemove` and `mouseup` events for tracking outside browser window
    - Enhanced `onMouseLeave()` to preserve drag state when leaving canvas
    - Added `getMousePositionFromDocument()` for handling document-level coordinate calculations
    - Preview block stays visible and functional even when mouse leaves window
    - Block creation completes normally regardless of where mouse is released
  - **Result**: Robust drag experience that works seamlessly across canvas, outside grid, and outside browser window
