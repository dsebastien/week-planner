- The visual quality of the canvas as a whole and text is horrible. There's also a lot of whitespace on the right of the sunday. Needs huge improvements.
- It should be possible to resize existing blocks (without overlapping other blocks)
- Text of the block should not overlap time of the block
- During block creation (during click and drag), the time of the block should be displayed
- A normal cursor should be used in general. A hand cursor (pointer) should be displayed when hovering an existing block
- A better font should be used
- It should be possible to select multiple blocks at once and edit them all with the toolbar
- The SVG export is broken
- When a block is selected, an edit toolbar should be displayed, similar to the one of Miro, with the following options: Background color, Text color, Font Size, Font Style (bold, italic, underlined, striked), Alignment (left, center, right), Border style, opacity, corners, color. 
- When right clicking on a time block, a menu should be shown with the following options: copy style, paste style (if one was copied previously), copy, duplicate
- The canvas should actually take the whole viewport! The buttons (export svg, png, clear all etc should be within)
- By default the text in a time block should be aligned center & middle
- In top left, time blocks should display start time - end time (duration in hours/minutes) (e.g., 13:00 - 14:00 (1h))
- Colors should be hex codes
- alignment (vertical, horizontal), etc should be enums
