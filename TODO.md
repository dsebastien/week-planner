Implement import from Markdown (assuming the Markdown template is used)

- Drastically improve the main UI to use a similar design to that of the block styling panel
- Cleanup Typescript imports. Import the normal typescript way, not from .js files!
- Move as much logic from the index.html to TypeScript
- How to quickly monetize this app and generate revenue?
- Create a README.md file. Update memory to ensure that all future changes are also reflected in the readme
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md file
- The code of this app is on GitHub and I want to build it and deploy it from there. I own dsebastien.net and want to deploy this at weekplanner.tools.dsebastien.net. My GitHub account has already two custom domains (dsebastien.net and stats.notes.dsebastien.net), so I suppose I could add one more. Generate the GitHub actions workflow I need to (release/build/deploy...). The release creation should also generate a changelog. Finally, explain how I should setup everything step by step
- Turn this into an Obsidian plugin
- When exporting to PNG, the image should have the perfect size for being printed on an horizontal A4 page
- Add gradients to time blocks based on their background color
- Make this work great on mobile
- UI quality should remain great even when zooming in/out
