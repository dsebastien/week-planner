BUSY:

- How to quickly monetize this app and generate revenue?
- Cleanup Typescript imports. Import the normal typescript way, not from .js files!
- The code of this app is on GitHub and I want to build it and deploy it from there. I own dsebastien.net and want to deploy this at weekplanner.tools.dsebastien.net. My GitHub account has already two custom domains (dsebastien.net and stats.notes.dsebastien.net), so I suppose I could add one more. Generate the GitHub actions workflow I need to (release/build/deploy...). The release creation should also generate a changelog. Finally, explain how I should setup everything step by step
- Block Resize handles should be bigger/easier to click on
- Add ctrl + z support (mention it in the list of shortcuts in the menu). Maintain an history of the last 100 operations. The history should be cleared after a clear all and also after an import
- Create a README.md file. Update memory to ensure that all future changes are also reflected in the readme
- Implement import from Markdown (assuming the Markdown template is used)
