Busy:

- When importing, if an event is called "Untitled", the time block should have no text
- Ultra think a plan to move all the logic that is currently in index.html to TypeScript. Do this one feature at a time. Make sure to respect/enhance the code's architecture and design. Also, write tests for each part before the move. Then, move, validate the behavior after the move, add tests, make sure those tests pass, ...
- UI quality should remain perfect even when zooming in/out and also when exporting to PNG
- Ultra think a plan add React and to turn all of the UI elements that are currently defined/used in index.html to React code
- UI quality should remain perfect even when zooming in/out and also when exporting to PNG
- The code of this app is on GitHub and I want to build it and deploy it from there. I own dsebastien.net and want to deploy this at weekplanner.tools.dsebastien.net. My GitHub account has already two custom domains (dsebastien.net and stats.notes.dsebastien.net), so I suppose I could add one more. Generate the GitHub actions workflow I need to (release/build/deploy...). The release creation should also generate a changelog. Finally, explain how I should setup everything step by step
- Turn this into an Obsidian plugin
