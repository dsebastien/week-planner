- start at 5:00 instead of 6:00
- It should be possible to resize existing blocks (without overlapping other blocks)
- Remove the "Block color" selector in the header. When a block is selected, an edit toolbar should be displayed, similar to the one of Miro, with the following options: Background color, Text color, Font Size, Font Style (bold, italic, underlined, striked), Alignment (left, center, right), Border style, opacity, corners, color. 
- A normal cursor should be used in general. A hand cursor (pointer) should be displayed when hovering an existing block
- A better font should be used
- It should be possible to select multiple blocks at once and edit them all with the toolbar
- By default the text in a time block should be aligned center & middle
- alignment (vertical, horizontal), etc should be enums
- When right clicking on a time block, a menu should be shown with the following options: copy style, paste style (if one was copied previously), copy. When right clicking on an empty cell, the menu should show the following options: paste (if a time block was copied previously), Add time block here
- the border style and color of selected time blocks should be nicer
- ctrl + a should select all blocks
- when releasing the mouse after click + drag over existing time blocks, it should select those that are completely in the selected area
- When clicking and dragging outside of the grid, the preview block disappears and the operation is cancelled on mouse relese. Instead, the "preview block" should be limited by the grid (remain visible) and it should be added normally
- Have a domain called dsebastien.net. Want to store this app on GitHub and deploy on weekplanner.tools.dsebastien.net. How to handle this?


- showError(message: string) should display a notification, not an alert
