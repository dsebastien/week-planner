Busy:
- SVG Export not okay. Need to be printable on an A4 at 100% scale
- Export/Import JSON OK. Export/Import Markdown: incomplete. Amandine: missing "Ecole" blocks that span Mon-Tue & Thu-Fri
- Menu doesn't display correctly on all screen sizes
- Ultra think a plan to move all the logic that is currently in index.html to TypeScript. Write the plan to disk. The idea should be to move ONE function/code block at the time, making 100% sure to keep the code fully functional while enhancing the application's architecture and code design. Also, write tests for each moved part, so the whole codebase is well tested
- Ultra think a plan add React and to turn all of the UI elements that are currently defined/used in index.html to React code
- The release creation should also generate a changelog. Finally, explain how I should setup everything step by step
- Turn this into an Obsidian plugin
