Busy:

- UI quality should remain perfect even when zooming in/out
- Cleanup Typescript imports. Import the normal typescript way, not from .js files!
- Move as much logic from the index.html to TypeScript
- The code of this app is on GitHub and I want to build it and deploy it from there. I own dsebastien.net and want to deploy this at weekplanner.tools.dsebastien.net. My GitHub account has already two custom domains (dsebastien.net and stats.notes.dsebastien.net), so I suppose I could add one more. Generate the GitHub actions workflow I need to (release/build/deploy...). The release creation should also generate a changelog. Finally, explain how I should setup everything step by step
- Turn this into an Obsidian plugin
- Don't show resize handles when multiple blocks are selected
- Import markdown (when successful) should be supported by undo and redo. Same for import json
- Editing text on a block that spans 1 and last columns breaks the UI
