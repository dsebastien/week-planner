- It should be possible to resize existing blocks (without overlapping other blocks)
- Text of the block should not overlap time of the block
- During block creation (during click and drag), the time of the block should be displayed
- The text quality of the canvas is horrible, needs huge improvements
- A normal cursor should be used in general. A hand cursor (pointer) should be displayed when hovering an existing block
- A better font should be used
- When a block is selected, an edit toolbar should be displayed, similar to the one of Miro, with the following options: Background color, Text color, Font Size, Font Style (bold, italic, underlined, striked), Alignment (left, center, right), Border style, opacity, corners, color. 
- It should be possible to select multiple blocks at once and edit them all with the toolbar
- The SVG export is broken
